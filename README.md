# <Study Guide Webpage>

## A small study guide webpage covering all prework topics for the UCF Bootcamp Prework module.

This is an interactive study guide, hosted on Github pages, containing information about the languages with which it was built, (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) as well as associated information on basic programming principals.

- This guide is designed to be accessible anywhere you have internet connection.
- It was built as both a convinient and interactive way to quickly access information, and as a way to practice the skills used to build and deploy such a webpage.
- This interactive study guide is both a useful tool, as well as a learning experience. Also, being abstract and virtual, it can hold an infinite amount of information, in various forms of media, while retaining the same physical footprint!  
- I learned a great deal, from interacting with the terminal, to Github and version control, program flow, and so much more.  Simply put, I learmed that magic is real, and it resides in the simple on/off of electrical signals.
